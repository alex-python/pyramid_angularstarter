# Pyramid Angular Starter

This is a project scaffold for the [pyramid web
framework](http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about) that
is setup for javascript development using
[angularjs](https://angularjs.org/) and other nice things.

Hopefully it will save you an hour or 2 when you are starting that
next awesome twitter clone.
